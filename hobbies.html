    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Cricket - My favourite sport, cricket is the thing I love doing most in my<br/>
            free tine. I play for my school and for my club and go training 4 times a <br/>
            week.
        </li>
        <li>Video Editing - Alongside coding, I love to edit videos. I take videos of <br/>
            myself playing sports, working or doing any other hobby and edit it to <br/>
            create a beautiful, free-flowing video.
        </li>
        <li>Working Out - I go to the gym every day and care a lot about my physical<br/>
            activity and health. I also do calisthenics at home and do plyometrics to <br/>
            help me with cricket.
