        I am a 14 year old freelance web developer. From a young age, I have had <br />

        quickly progress in my programming journey. I am a hardworking, disciplined <br />
        individual who always strives to provide clients with the best websites money <br />
        can buy. Currently I work part-time but in the future I would like to work as <br/>
        a full time developer.
